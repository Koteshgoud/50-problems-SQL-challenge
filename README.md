Welcome to my 50 SQL Problems Challenge repository!

I have embarked on a journey to solve 50 SQL problems, and I will be posting each solution here. This challenge is aimed at sharpening my SQL skills and sharing my progress with the community.

## What to Expect
Problem Descriptions: Each problem will have a clear description outlining the requirements.
SQL Solutions: Solutions will be provided for each problem, including the SQL queries used.
Learning Outcomes: Key takeaways and learning points from each problem will be documented.
## Why This Challenge?
Solving SQL problems is a great way to:

Enhance problem-solving skills.
Understand different SQL concepts and techniques.
Prepare for technical interviews and real-world SQL tasks.
## How to Navigate
Each problem and its solution will be in a separate folder named 'Problem_X', where 'X' is the problem number.
## Example Folder Structure:
- Problem_1
  - problem_description.md
  - solution.sql
- Problem_2
  - problem_description.md
  - solution.sql
